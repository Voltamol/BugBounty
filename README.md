program to detect bugs in code

A Code linter, is a static code analysis tool used to:
- flag programming errors,
- bugs,
- stylistic errors,
- and suspicious constructs.
The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. Like Google, “lint” became a verb that meant static checking your source code.

Everyone knows that programming errors are bad. Some errors cause:
- glitches that frustrate users
- Others compromise the safety and security of a critical system.

Linting is an essential process and __code linters are available across programming languages__. Here, will work specifically on the Python Linter aka Pylint.
Pylint checks your code against the `norms stated in the styling guide` for Python as stated in PEP-8.
