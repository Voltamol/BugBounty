# BugBounty
program to detect bugs in code

A Code linter, is a static code analysis tool used to:
- flag programming errors,
- bugs,
- stylistic errors,
- and suspicious constructs.
The term originates from a Unix utility that examined C language source code. Like Google, “lint” became a verb that meant static checking your source code.

Everyone knows that programming errors are bad. Some errors cause:
- glitches that frustrate users
- Others compromise the safety and security of a critical system.

Linting is an essential process and __code linters are available across programming languages__. Here, will work specifically on the Python Linter aka Pylint.
Pylint checks your code against the `norms stated in the styling guide` for Python as stated in PEP-8.

Pylint is a tool that:
- checks for errors in Python code
- tries to enforce a coding standard and
- looks for __code smells__.
- It can also look for certain type errors,
- it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored and
- can offer you details about the code’s complexity.

Pylint will display:
- a number of messages as it analyzes the code and
- it can also be used for displaying some statistics about the number of warnings and errors found in different files.
The messages are classified under various categories such as errors and warnings.

_Last but not least, the code is given an overall mark, based on the number and severity of the warnings and errors_
